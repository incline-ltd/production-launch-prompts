# Solo Founder Production Launch Prompts

20 audit-first prompts for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other codebase-aware
agents.

Use one prompt at a time. Do not run this whole file as one giant prompt.

Global operating rules for every prompt:

- Start by running `git status --short --branch` and report the branch/status.
- Do not modify files unless the user explicitly asks for implementation.
- Do not print secret values. If you find one, report only the file path, key
  name/type, and rotation risk.
- Prefer specific file paths, line numbers, and concrete fixes over broad advice.
- Separate confirmed findings from assumptions.
- End with ranked next actions.
